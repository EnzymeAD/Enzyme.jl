# <img src="https://enzyme.mit.edu/logo.svg" width="75" align=left> The Enzyme High-Performance Automatic Differentiator of LLVM

This is a package containing the Julia bindings for Enzyme. This is very much a work in progress and bug reports/discussion is greatly appreciated!

Enzyme is a plugin that performs automatic differentiation (AD) of statically analyzable LLVM. It is highly-efficient and its ability perform AD on optimized code allows Enzyme to meet or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art AD tools.

Enzyme.jl can be installed in the usual way Julia packages are installed
```
] add Enzyme
```

Enzyme.jl can be used by calling `autodiff` on a function to be differentiated as shown below:

```julia
using Enzyme

f1(x) = x*x
@test autodiff(f1, Active(1.0)) â‰ˆ 2.0
```

More information on installing and using Enzyme can be found on our website: [https://enzyme.mit.edu](https://enzyme.mit.edu).
