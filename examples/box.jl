# # Enzyme for adjoint tutorial: Stommel three-box ocean model

# The goal of this tutorial is to teach about a specific usage of Enzyme's automatic 
# differentiation capabilities, and will be centered around the Stommel ocean model. This 
# is a nice example to see how powerful Enzyme is, and the ability of it to take a 
# derivative of a complicated function (namely one that has many parts and parameters).
# This tutorial will focus first on the computations and getting Enzyme running, 
# for those interested a mathematical explanation of the model and what an adjoint 
# variable is will be provided at the end. 

# # Brief model overview 

# The Stommel box model can be viewed as a watered down full ocean model. In our example, we have three
# boxes (Box One, Box Two, and Box Three) and we model the transport of fluid between 
# them. The full equations of our system are given by:
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
#    U &= u_0 \left\{ \rho_2 - \left[ \rho_1 + (1 - \delta) \rho_3 \right] \right\} \\
#    \rho_i &= -\alpha T_i + \beta S_i, \; \; \; \; i = 1, 2, 3
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# for the **transport** U and **densities** ``\rho``, and then the time derivatives
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
#    \dot{T_1} &= U(T_3 - T_1)/V_1 + \gamma (T_1^* - T_1 ) & \dot{S_1} &= U(S_3 - S_1)/V_1 + FW_1/V_1 \\
#    \dot{T_2} &= U(T_1 - T_2)/V_2 + \gamma (T_2^* - T_2 ) & \dot{S_2} &= U(S_1 - S_2)/V_2 + FW_2/V_2 \\
#    \dot{T_3} &= U(T_2 - T_3)/V_3 & \dot{S_3} &= U(S_2 - S_3)/V_3 
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# for positive transport, ``U > 0``, and 
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
#    \dot{T_1} &= U(T_2 - T_1)/V_1 + \gamma (T_1^* - T_1) & \dot{S_1} &= U(S_2 - S_1)/V_1 + FW_1/V_1 \\
#    \dot{T_2} &= U(T_3 - T_2)/V_2 + \gamma (T_2^* - T_2 ) & \dot{S_2} &= U(S_3 - S_2)/V_2 + FW_2/V_2 \\
#    \dot{T_3} &= U(T_1 - T_3)/V_3 & \dot{S_3} &= U(S_1 - S_3)/V_3 
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# for ``U \leq 0``.
# The only force driving our system is a density gradient generated via temperature
# and salinity differences between the boxes. This makes it a really easy 
# model to play around with! With this in mind, the model is run 
# forward with the steps:
#
# 1) Compute densities
# 2) Compute transport 
# 3) Compute time derivatives of the box temperatures and salinities
# 4) Update the state vector
#
# We'll start by going through the model setup step by step, then providing a few test 
# cases with Enzyme.  

# # Model setup 

# ## Model dependencies

# Let's first add the necessary packages to run everything 

using Enzyme 

# ## Initialize constants

# The system equations have quite a few constants that appear, here we initialize them
# for later use. We'll do this in a Julia way: we have an empty structure that will hold 
# all the parameters, and a function (we'll call this `setup`) that initializes them. 
# This means that, so long as we don't need to change parameters, we only need to run `setup`
# once.

# One difference to note is that`one_step_forward` now returns nothing, but is rather a function of both its input

# # Example 1: Simply using Enzyme

# For the first example let's just compute the gradient of our forward function and 
# examine the output. We'll just run the model for one step, and take a `dt` of ten 
# days. The initial conditions of the system are given as `Tbar` and `Sbar`. We run setup once here, 
# and never have to run it again! (Unless we decide to change a parameter)

# In order to run Enzyme on `one_step_forward`, we've needed to provide quite a few 
# placeholders, and wrap everything in [`Duplicated`](@ref) as all components of our function 
# are vectors, not scalars. Let's go through and see what Enzyme did with all 
# of those placeholders. 

# First we can look at what happened to the zero vectors out_now and out_old:

@show out_now, out_old

# Comparing to the results of forward func:

@show states_before_smoother[2], states_after_smoother[2]

# we see that Enzyme has computed and stored exactly the output of the 
# forward step. Next, let's look at `dstate_now`: 

@show dstate_now 

# Just a few numbers, but this is what makes AD so nice: Enzyme has exactly computed
# the derivative of all outputs with respect to the input in_now, evaluated at
# in_now, and acted with this gradient on what we gave as dout_now (in our case, 
# all ones). In math language, this is just
# ```math 
# \text{dstate now} = (\frac{\partial \text{out now}(\text{state now})}{\partial \text{state now}} + \frac{\partial \text{out old}(\text{state now})}{\partial \text{state now}}) \text{dout now} 
# ```

# We note here that had we initialized `dstate_now` and `dstate_old` as something else, our results 
# will change. Let's multiply them by two and see what happens. 

dstate_now_new = zeros(6)

    Duplicated(out_now, dout_now), 
    Duplicated(out_old, dout_old),
    parameters, 
    Const(10*parameters.day)
)

# Now checking `dstate_now` and `dstate_old` we see

@show dstate_now_new

# # What happened? Enzyme is actually taking the computed gradient and acting on what we
# # give as input to dout_now and dout_old. Checking this, we see

@show 2*dstate_now

# and they match the new results. This exactly matches what we'd expect to happen since 
# we scaled `dout_now` by two. 

# Example 2: Full sensitivity calculations

# Now we want to use Enzyme for a bit more than just a single derivative. Let's 
# say we'd like to understand how sensitive the final temperature of Box One is to the initial 
# salinity of Box Two. That is, given the function 

# ```math
# J = (1,0,0,0,0,0)^T \cdot \mathbf{x}(t_f)
# ```
# we want Enzyme to calculate the derivative 

# ```math
# \frac{\partial J}{\partial \mathbf{x}(0)}
# ```

# where ``x(t)`` is the state of the model at time t. If we think about ``x(t_f)`` as solely depending on the 
# initial condition, then this derivative is really 

# ```math
# \frac{\partial J}{\partial \mathbf{x}(0)} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}(0)} \left( (1,0,0,0,0,0)^T \cdot L(\ldots(L(\mathbf{x}(0)))) \right) 
# ```

# with ``L(x(t)) = x(t + dt)``, i.e. one forward step. One could expand this derivative with the chain rule (and it would be very complicated), but really this 
# is where Enzyme comes in. Each run of autodiff on our forward function is one piece of this big chain rule done for us! We also note that the chain rule
# goes from the outside in, so we start with the derivative of the forward function at the final state, and work backwards until the initial state.
# To get Enzyme to do this, we complete the following steps:
# 1) Run the forward model and store outputs (in a real ocean model this wouldn't be 
#       feasible and we'd need to use checkpointing)
# 2) Compute the initial derivative from the final state 
# 3) Use Enzyme to work backwards until we reach the desired derivative. 

# For simplicity we define a function that takes completes our AD steps
